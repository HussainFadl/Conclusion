    "The optional final task of this course consists of your own AI idea. We are not giving you a made-up problem to solve. Instead, we want to hear what kind of a problem you'd like to solve using AI – and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you have worked within the safe harbor of this course. The goal was to let you focus on the content instead of learning to install and use new applications and systems. The content was structured as small nuggets that you could solve one at a time to eventually construct the bigger picture – not unlike a jigsaw puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But real-world problems aren't always served in single-serve portions. It's also necessary to practice the art of identifying a specific problem and sketching a solution without having a ready-made problem statement to begin with. Building AI solutions for real-world problems also requires that we venture out of our safe harbor and engage with the world. This can mean actively seeking more information about a problem, talking to those affected by it, teaming up with the rest of the AI community, and learning to use new tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can browse example projects created by others to gain inspiration, but don't hesitate to be creative and to think outside the box. The best-case scenario is that, with time, your project will grow into something that creates real change in your own community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the AI Idea Gallery\n",
    "It's time for your AI idea\n",
    "To make it easier for you, we’re proposing you structure the project description around a list of topics. Once you have written down a few thoughts about each of these topics, you already have enough material to submit your project! If you’re up to it, you can also expand this into a working demo or prototype with code and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics we’ll ask you to elaborate are:\n",
    "Your idea in a nutshell: Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.\n",
    "Background: What is the problem your idea will solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?\n",
    "Data and AI techniques: What data sources does your project depend on? Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential. Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful? Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data!\n",
    "How is it used: What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom? Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected.\n",
    "Challenges: What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations.\n",
    "What next: How could your project grow and become something even more?\n",
    "Acknowledgments: If you’re using open source code or documents in your project, make sure you give credit to the creators. Mention your sources of inspiration, too.\n",
    "To complete this final project and to earn final project honors on your certificate, you should submit your idea formulated according to these questions as a README-file on GitHub. If this sounds new to you, don’t worry, we’ll guide you through the steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this template whenever you want to craft and communicate your AI idea to anyone. If you already know who to send the idea to in order to take it forward, we encourage you to do so – you don’t have to submit an idea to pass this course. But if you feel you want to share something fun and useful with the world and find people to collaborate with to make your AI idea a reality, read on.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works\n",
    "Your AI idea project will not be graded by us (but if you submit an idea this will be mentioned on your certificate of completion for the course). You should think of it as something that you can do for yourself and your own community, not for us. It will also serve as a demonstration of your skills and your creativity. So even if the project is not required by us, we think it's an integral part of the Elements of AI journey: this is your gateway to the AI community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially if you are doing your first AI project, you may feel intimidated and worried that it will turn out to be less than awesome. Don't worry, you can always continue to improve it and start new, perhaps even better projects. Doing great projects takes years of practice, but you have to start one day. Why not make today that day?\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the final project made and shared?\n",
    "We will be using GitHub as the platform to store and share your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose GitHub as a platform for the AI ideas because it has such a strong foothold in the AI community and in the coding profession in general. If you’re into coding, you most likely already know this and have an account, and if not, let us assure you that it will be useful for you to have one when continuing your journey. In this project, you'll be creating a GitHub repository. Don't worry, it's easy and it's something that everyone in the AI scene tends to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note!\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is for collaboration\n",
    "GitHub is an online service for hosting git-based version control for software projects. Git is a technology originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, who is also known as the creator of the Linux operating system. With Git, developer teams can coordinate their work, avoid conflicts between different project versions and track file changes. Learning to use GitHub's basic functionality can be beneficial no matter what your profession is. It may even be newsworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final project submission will be a README in your Git repository\n",
    "The readme file (or README in all caps) is an established way to share the documentation of a software project for users and developers. In GitHub, it’s the first page that’s shown to anyone who visits a project. A good README contains a description of the project and a user guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, it’s enough to create just the README page – a kind of a poster for a future project. If you make it nice and inviting, who knows if one day you’ll find just the right people to collaborate with to make it a reality!\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who program: we’d love it if you include an experiment, a demo or a prototype with the actual code in your repository. It can be your original work, but don’t forget the lovely world of sharing and contributing with open source projects. No matter what kind of project you’re planning to get started with, checking out some interesting and fun experiments can be fuel for your imagination (some of these examples are even accompanied with open source code).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the copyright\n",
    "You can only use other people’s code, images, or other assets in your projects if the original creator has given the permission to do so. You can of course ask for permission personally, but sometimes you don’t have to: many creators license their work as Open Source or Creative Commons when they want to allow reuse under specific conditions. Even if a project is shared with the world under such a license, you still need to respect the creators’ rights to their work: for example, in most cases, you need to mention who the creator is. Sharing is the cornerstone of modern, digital culture – we encourage you to contribute to this culture by licensing your own work, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your project page\n",
    "To get started, log in to GitHub. Create an account if you don't have one yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new README, you need to create a GitHub repository first. The repository is the home to all your project files: text, code, images, sound – any assets needed. At minimum, you can create a text file and add a few images to beautify the project description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a GIF of how to create a repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "repo creation\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new repository from the ‘+’ menu and set up the project\n",
    "Give your repository a short, unique name. The name can be changed afterwards from Settings if you don’t yet know what the topic of the project will be\n",
    "The repository must be created as Public so you can share it as your Building AI final project\n",
    "Check the box ‘Initialize this repository with a README’\n",
    "If you want, you can learn about adding a license to your project (or change the setting later). With licenses you control how your project can be used by others\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the README project plan\n",
    "Now it’s time to draft your project plan into a README file. The README in GitHub is formatted using markdown, which is a common way to add styling to text. Markdown is used on many online platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things simple, we’ve created a template you can use to draft your README:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- This is the markdown template for the final project of the Building AI course, \n",
    "created by Reaktor Innovations and University of Helsinki. \n",
    "Copy the template, paste it to your GitHub README and edit! -->\n",

    "A heading called Summary (created in markdown like this: ##Summary)\n",
    "A short description text (about 250 characters) under Summary\n",
    "The words “Building AI course project” - for example right under the Project title or at the end of the Summary\n",
    "Some formatting, for example headings: Tags # and ## are used to create headings – you can keep the example headings to create structure on the README\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding images\n",
    "Create a clear picture of your project with images like charts, screenshots or photos. To add files, go to the start of your project repository.\n",

    "upload files\n",
    "After adding files, you need to commit the changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "commit to repo\n",
    "When you perform a commit, you are saving the current state of the project repository. This way you can go back in history, see the changes made to any of your project files, and reset the project to a previous state if needed. When collaborating with others, this is an essential feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add images to your README, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Link to an image you’ve uploaded to your repository like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Or link to an online image:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Mastering markdown\n",
    "Markdown cheatsheet\n",
    "How about adding some code?\n",
    "If you are familiar with coding, consider forking the repository of an interesting, open source AI project. This is a nice way to start experimenting, even if you’re not very experienced with coding. It’s a good practice to only fork repositories that have been licensed as open source. Technically you can fork any public repositories, but you can’t build your work on them without the license.\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you add code to the mix, you’ll need to use some desktop tools as well. In practice, you’ll write and edit code on your computer using a code editor of your choice, then push the changes you make to your GitHub repository using some Git magic. If it’s all new to you, don’t worry – you’ll learn it by doing it. Here’s a good tutorial to get you started: Git Handbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your project\n",
    "Go to the main page of your AI project in GitHub. You’re on the main page if the address is in this format: https://github.com/username/repo-name\n",
    "Copy the address of the repository and paste it into the text field below.\n",
    "Press the 'Submit' button.\n",
    "After submitting the repository:\n",
    "Give peer reviews to three other projects\n",
    "Your project is accepted when you have given and received enough peer reviews.\n",
    "Note: GitHub repositories submitted as Building AI course projects may be showcased by Reaktor and University of Helsinki when we communicate about the course in different contexts.
